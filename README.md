# python-challenge
In this Python challenge, two sets of datasets were analyzed to provide useful information for the users: the first dataset was to analyze financial information for a bank, and the second set was to analyze the results of voting in a small, rural town. This is to also point out the advantages of using coding Python over, for example, VBA. 
The first code performed to Pybank, was to count the total number of months, total amount of the transactions, as well as the average change of profit and loss, and the corresponding greatest decrease and increase.
The second code performed the total count of votes submitted in the election. Not only that, but both codes display the results in the terminal as well as save a file with the final output in a specific folder. Based on the results, we could conclude that the greatest increase in profits for PyBank happened on August 16, while the greatest decrease on February 14th. As well as there were 369,711 votes in total for the PyPoll.
